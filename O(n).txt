VectorTester

Constructor - O(n)
PushBack- O(n) (when reallocation occurs) (worst case) 
PushBack- O(1) (when no reallocation occurs) (amortized)
RandomInsertion of 1 element- O(n)
RandomRemoval of 1 element- O(n)
Operator= - O(n)
Sorting - O( n*log(n) )
Finding a specific element,
provided the vector is sorted - O( log(n) )
